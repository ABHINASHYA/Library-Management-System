Library Management System (Java)

A simple, console-based Library Management System developed in Java. The project is structured in multiple classes to manage books, students, and library operations in a menu-driven application 
GeeksforGeeks
.

Project Structure
File	Description
Library.java	Main application entry point, handles the menu and execution flow.
books.java	Manages a collection of books and related operations.
Library.java	(Duplicateâ€”if needed, clarify or merge duplicate content.)
student.java	Represents a single student's details.
students.java	Manages student records and book borrowing logic.
Features

Typical functionality in a Java Library Management System includes:

Book Management

Add new books to the collection

Search existing books

Show all books

Update book quantities 
GeeksforGeeks

Student Management

Register new students

Display list of all registered students 
GeeksforGeeks

Library Operations

Check out books to students

Check-in returned books

Maintain clear borrowing records 
GeeksforGeeks

This modular separation allows for cleaner organization and better maintainability.

Learning Objectives-
Practice core Java concepts: classes, objects, arrays or collections, I/O operations, and console-based UI.
Apply menu-driven logic via switch statements to handle user input 
Manage data separation for books and students to enhance modularity and code clarity.
